# AI-Powered Phishing Email Detector

This project is a web application that uses Transformer models to detect phishing emails in real-time.

## Features
- Analyze emails using four different models: BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and MiniLM.
- A "Complete Analysis" mode to compare results from all models.
- A hybrid system that combines the AI score with rule-based indicators.

## Setup

### 1. Data and Models
The training dataset (`final_cleaned.csv`) and the fine-tuned models are too large for this repository.

- **Dataset**: The dataset can be downloaded from [Link to your dataset on Google Drive, Kaggle, etc.]. Place it in a `Data_Set` folder.
- **Models**: The trained models can be generated by running the `LLM_Train.py` script. The script will create the `models` folder with all the necessary files.

### 2. Running the Application
1.  Install the required Python packages: `pip install flask transformers torch scikit-learn pandas`
2.  Run the Flask server: `python app.py`
3.  Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
